                  <b>Order Submitted - "Placed"</b>
                  <br /> Once you have placed your order on Aodour, your order
                  status will appear as "Placed."

                  <b>Order Processing - "In Progress"</b>
                  <br /> Once you have placed your order, it will be sent to our
                  warehouse to be processed and packed for shipment. During this
                  time, your order status will appear as "In Progress." Please
                  allow 3 - 5 business days for the order to be processed and
                  prepared for shipment. Once the order enters the "In Progress"
                  status, no changes, or cancellations of your order can be
                  made.

                  <br />
                  It takes up to 10 to 15 days to process the return. Once your
                  order has been returned and processed, the order status will
                  show "Returned." We will notify you via e-mail once your

            <h5>CANCELING OR MODIFYING AN ORDER</h5>
            <p>
              Before you place your order, you can view the contents and the
              total amount in your shopping basket. Once your order has been
              submitted successfully, the order will be placed in a "Placed"
              status. Your order is then "In Progress," entering the shipping
              process almost immediately. The only time that you can cancel or
              modify your order is during "Placed" status. Once your order
              enters the shipping process by being "In Progress," no further
              changes can be made.
              <br />
              <br />
              If the order has been "In Progress," we are unable to cancel or
              modify your order.
